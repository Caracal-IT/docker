# Custom Helm Charts

Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications — Helm Charts help you define,  
install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.  

Each chart is a bundle with one or more Kubernetes manifests – a chart can have  
child charts and dependent charts as well.  

## Create Helm Chart

You can use the following command to create a custom chart.

``` code
helm create myapp
```

## Install the Chart

The default is nginx, install the chart before any changes.  

``` code
helm install myapp01 myapp
```

Get the running pods.  

``` code
kubectl get pods
```

Test if the app was installed.  
The service type is ClusterIP and not load balancer.  
We need to do port forwarding to access the pod.

``` code
kubectl port-forward myapp01-59867f8fbf-wjn2c 8080:80
```

Open browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8080

## Templates

The helm charts cant talk to kubernetes on its own, The files in the  
templates forder contains the configs for kubernetes.  

Anything in the {{ }} is renderd. It will be cast to lowercase.  

## Package Helm Charts

You can zip the directory and put it on a shared drive.  

``` code
myapp tar -cvf myapp-1.0.0 .
```

This will result in multiple folders. We will use the helm command.  
There is no need to uncompress the file.

```
helm package .
```

**Install the package**  

``` code
helm install myapp2 /home/charts/myapp/myapp-0.1.0.tgz
```
