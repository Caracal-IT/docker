# Custom Helm Charts

Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications — Helm Charts help you define,  
install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.  

Each chart is a bundle with one or more Kubernetes manifests – a chart can have  
child charts and dependent charts as well.  

## Create Helm Chart

You can use the following command to create a custom chart.

``` code
helm create myapp
```

## Install the Chart

The default is nginx, install the chart before any changes.  

``` code
helm install myapp01 myapp
```

Get the running pods.  

``` code
kubectl get pods
```

Test if the app was installed.  
The service type is ClusterIP and not load balancer.  
We need to do port forwarding to access the pod.

``` code
kubectl port-forward myapp01-59867f8fbf-wjn2c 8080:80
```

Open browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8080

## Templates

The helm charts cant talk to kubernetes on its own, The files in the  
templates forder contains the configs for kubernetes.  

Anything in the {{ }} is renderd. It will be cast to lowercase.  

## Package Helm Charts

You can zip the directory and put it on a shared drive.  

``` code
myapp tar -cvf myapp-1.0.0 .
```

This will result in multiple folders. We will use the helm command.  
There is no need to uncompress the file.

```
helm package .
```

**Install the package**  

``` code
helm install myapp2 /home/charts/myapp/myapp-0.1.0.tgz
```

## Playground

You can use the dry run as a playground.

``` code
helm create playground 
```

Change the contents of NOTES.txt in the templates folder.  

``` code
helm install test --dry-run .
```

## Helm Functions

Helm use the following functions to make our lives easier.

Helm use the [sprig](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig) library.

**toYaml**

Converts the valiables to valid yaml format.


```
Resources:

{{ toYaml .Values.resources }}
```

**indent**

- ignore any white space beforte the code.
\the indent does not include the new line character, use nindent.

```
Resources:

{{- toYaml .Values.resources | indent 2}}
```

```
Resources:

{{- toYaml .Values.resources | nindent 2}}
```

## Config Map

The default template does not include a config map by default.  
Create configmap.yml file in the templates folder.  

**configmap.yml**

``` code
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ include "myapp.fullname" }}
data:
  default.json: |
  {{ .Files.Get "default.json" | indent 4 }}
```

**default.json** (NB!! This shoult be in the root)

``` code
{
    "network": {
        "port": "80"
    },
    "environment" : {
        "SSL": false
    }
}
```  

Add the secrets file in the templates.  

**secret.yaml**

``` code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: {{ include "myapp.fullname" . }}
type: Opaque
data:
  APIKEY: {{ "23409820984091809480198240981" | b64enc }}
```

Add volume mounts in the containers  

``` yaml
image: {.....}
volumeMounts: 
    name: config
    mountPath: /app/config/default.json
    subPath: default.json
env:
    - name: APIKEY
    valueFrom: 
        secretKeyRef:
            name: {{ include "myapp.fullname" . }}
            key: APIKEY
ports:
.......
----------
volumes:
    - name: config
        configMap:
            name: {{ include "myapp.fullname" . }}
```

You can also include a directory  

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ include "myapp.fullname" }}
data:
  default.json: |
  {{ (.Files.Glob "config/*").AsConfig | indent 4 }}
```

**secrets**  

``` code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: {{ include "myapp.fullname" . }}
type: Opaque
data:
  {{ (.Files.Glob "config/*").AsSecrets | indent 4 }}
```
