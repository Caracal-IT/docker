# Management Techniques

## Run, Expose and Create Generators
* These commands use templates named "generators"
* Every resource in k8s has a specification or "spec"
  ``` code
  kubectl create deploment sample --image nginx --dry-run -o yaml
  ```
* You can output those templates with **-dry-run -o yaml**
* Generators are "opionted defaults"
